# ADR 0011: Layouts

## Context
Currently, we do not implement custom layouts in our notes. This decision is influenced by the constraints of the Obsidian application and its mobile view.

## Decision
We will not implement custom layouts at this time. The primary reasons are:
1. **Obsidian Layout Constraints**: Obsidian's existing layout (Especially on mobile) does not provide sufficient width for anything other than blocks with full-width.

## Consequences
Nothing will change for now.

## Update
Custom Layouts will be implemented in a mobile-first fashion
